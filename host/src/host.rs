//! Core types and traits to implement a Clack host.
//!
//! The [`HostHandlers`] trait is the main one required to be implemented for a Clack host. It provides
//! the host's supported extensions and is associated to a main type implementing [`SharedHandler`] ,
//! as well as two more optional types implementing [`MainThreadHandler`] and [`AudioProcessorHandler`] (the
//! unit type `()` can be used as default implementations that do nothing).
//!
//! These three types must implement host interfaces to allow them to respond to various requests
//! from the plugin, following the CLAP thread model described below.
//!
//! # Thread specifications
//!
//! CLAP's thread model for plugins is split into three specifications of operations: those
//! happening in the main thread, those happening in an audio processing thread,
//! and thread-safe operations:
//!
//! * The *main thread* (`[main-thread]` in the CLAP specification): this is represented by a type
//!   implementing the [`MainThreadHandler`] trait, which is neither [`Send`] nor [`Sync`], and lives
//!   encapsulated in the [`PluginInstance`](crate::plugin::PluginInstance) struct.
//!
//!   This type can handle all non-realtime-safe operations, such as those related to buffer
//!   allocations or GUI handling, and extensions can extend its use to more kinds of operations.
//!
//!   This type is intended to stay on the thread it was created in (i.e. the "main" thread):
//!   implementations cannot [`Send`] this type to any other threads.
//!
//! * The *audio thread* (`[audio-thread]` in the CLAP specification): this is represented by a type
//!   implementing the [`AudioProcessorHandler`] trait, which is [`Send`] but
//!   [`!Sync`](Sync), and lives encapsulated in the
//!   [`PluginAudioProcessor`](crate::process::PluginAudioProcessor) struct. It is only
//!   instantiated when the [`activate`](crate::plugin::PluginInstance::activate) method is called,
//!   and is dropped on [`deactivate`](crate::plugin::PluginInstance::deactivate). If it isn't
//!   needed , `()` can be used instead.
//!
//!   This type is designed to handle all DSP-related requests from the plugin and lives in one of
//!   the host's audio threads, of which there may be multiple, if the host uses a thread pool for
//!   example.
//!
//!   The host is free to [`Send`] the [`AudioProcessorHandler`] type between any of its audio threads,
//!   but any operation of this class is guaranteed to be called by only a single thread
//!   simultaneously ([`!Sync`](Sync)).
//!
//!   One exception is for CLAP plugins' activation and deactivation (represented in Clack by the
//!   plugin type's construction and destruction), which is guaranteed to happen in the Main Thread
//!   instead. This allows an [`AudioProcessorHandler`] implementation to receive temporary exclusive
//!   references to the [`MainThreadHandler`] type during its construction and destruction, to take
//!   and release ownership of extra buffers for instance.
//!
//! * *Thread-safe operations* (`[thread-safe]` in the CLAP specification) are represented by a type
//!   implementing the [`SharedHandler`] trait, which is both [`Send`] and [`Sync`], and will be
//!   shared between the main thread and the audio thread.
//!
//!   It can be used to hold read-only data (such as all the detected plugin extensions), or to
//!   hold any other kind of state that is to be synchronized between multiple threads.
//!
//!   However, it should be noted that this type *can* be used by the plugin simultaneously from
//!   threads that are neither the main thread nor the audio thread.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This example implements a basic host which is able to process callback requests from the plugin,
//! along with two extensions: `latency` and `log`.
//!
//! This is done by implementing the [`HostHandlers`] trait and specifying its associated types:
//! [`SharedHandler`], [`MainThreadHandler`], and [`AudioProcessorHandler`].
//!
//! Because our host supports some extensions, we also implement the [`HostHandlers::declare_extensions`]
//! method to declare them to the plugin, which requires us to implement the associated traits on
//! the appropriate [`HostHandlers`] associated types to handle the host-side.
//!
//! For more information about which extension traits needs to be implemented on which time, refer
//! to that extension's documentation.
//!
//! For more information about how to work with extensions, see the
//! [`extensions`](crate::extensions) module documentation.
