# clap-plugin

A safe wrapper to create plugins using the [CLAP](https://github.com/free-audio/clap) audio API.

This library is an exploratory attempt to make safe bindings to CLAP, built on top of [`clap-sys`](https://github.com/glowcoil/clap-sys).

It should be considered **highly experimental** and subject to change, and is far from being ready for production use.

This library is also very incomplete. At the moment, there is barely enough for an example Gain plugin to run.
